# Example 3

I recommend using the Vagrant image from the parent directory which
will give you a Linux-based virtual machine with maven
pre-installed. I've tested that works for these examples.

However, you can try to install maven directly on your Mac and run
things locally, but I haven't verified any other installation
instructions:

```
brew install maven
```

This example sets up a full project using Maven. You can take a look
at the `pom.xml` to see what a fairly basic project setup is going to
look like. Free free to copy & modify that to get your initial
projects started.
